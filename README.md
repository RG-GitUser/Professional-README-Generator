# Professional README Generator

#### Description

In this project, I have demonstrated how I can use node.js to create a professional README template from the terminal. 

## Installation

1. From the "Professional-README-Generator" repository (https://github.com/RG-GitUser/Professional-README-Generator) select the "Code" dropdown.
2. Using the "Code" dropdown, click on "SSH".
3. On the "SSH" tab, select the "copy" button next to  the address.
4. Next, open your git bash terminal (or for mac users, homebrew)
5. Use the command "git clone" and "insert coppied SSH key here" then press enter. 
6. Enter the "cd "enter path here" " command to navigate to the correct directory. 
7. You now have the repository cloned to your system! To verify, the command "ls" to view the items listed inside of the repository. 

## Usage

Users are able to create a professional README document from their terminal.
